### Key Features:
- **Interactive Simulation**: Use sliders to adjust the digits and guess the 2-digit code.
- **Feedback**: Provides real-time feedback on the current guess and success message when the correct code is found.
- **QR Code for Mobile Practice**: A QR code is generated, allowing students to scan and access the interactive challenge directly on their mobile devices.

### Concept:
This app simulates a simple 2-digit lock challenge, where students need to guess a secret 2-digit code (in this case, 27) by adjusting the sliders for two digits.
